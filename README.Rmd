## About

**{ps50sr}** is a repository for the applications and tools developed by this author for an interview with the Council of State Government Justice Center. 

In essence, this package is centered around the data found on the ["50-State Report on Public Safety" website](https://50statespublicsafety.us/). The data sets used to create dynamic visualizations on "Past 1, Strategy 1: Use data to understand crime trends" was downloaded, reshaped and stored as a portable .sqlite database to serve as the backbone to this demonstration. For more information on how the data was procured and saved, please look at the documentation on the repo: `docs/data-pulling/*`.

## Installation

The R installation can be accomplished using **{remotes}**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if(!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cjcallag/ps50sr")
```

With the package installed, you can proceed to use the functions either loading the library (`library(ps50sr)`) or via the namespace (`escaexplorer::`). 

## Fetching Data

Load library:

```{r}
library(ps50sr)
```

Once you install and launch the package, you may access to the portable .sqlite database of state crimes and arrests data as a system file within **{ps50sr}** package. First, you will need to establish a connection to this portable database. Note that you will need the **{RSQLite}** and **{DBI}** packages to establish that connection:

```{r}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
                      ps50sr:::.sys_file("extdata/ps50sr.sqlite"))
```

With the connection established, you may proceed to query data:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
res <- ps50sr::fetch_table(conn = con, table = "arrests", 
                           # Coerce data.frame to data.table by reference
                           dt = TRUE,
                           # Print SQL query to console
                           verbose = FALSE)
head(res)
```

The `fetch_table()` function is essentially a wrapper enabling the user to query an SQL database. As such, additional arguments can be passed in order to refine these queries.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
res <- ps50sr::fetch_table(conn = con, table = "arrests", 
                           # Coerce data.frame to data.table by reference
                           dt = TRUE,
                           # Print SQL query to console
                           verbose = FALSE,
                           # Additional query arguments
                           where = "State = 'California' AND Variable = '2017'")

# Remove URL column from print
res[, -c("URL")]
```

## Launching **{shiny}** Apps

The **{shiny}** application(s) included in this package can be launched programmatically using the  `launch_app()` function. At this time, the only valid **{shiny}** application included is `ps50sr-dashboard` which can be launched like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ps50sr::launch_app(app = "ps50sr-dashboard",
                   use_browser = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "docs/imgs/app.png")
```

By default the function uses the "0.0.0.0" as the default IPv4 address and TCP port 3838. However, these parameters can be modified through the function's arguments. For more information, look at the documentation, `?escaexplorer::launch_app`.

## Launching **{plumber}** Web API

In addition to HTML applications, this package contains a web API that extends the functionality of the functions in this this package.

```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ps50sr::launch_api(port = 591, docs = FALSE)
```

With the API running you can visit this URL using a browser or a terminal to run your R function and get the results. For instance, http://localhost:591/echo?msg=hello will echo back the ‘hello’ message you provided. Here a Mac terminal is used:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
curl "http://localhost:591/echo?msg=hello"
 {"msg":["The message is: 'hello'"]}
```

This API extends the functions in the package. For example, you may query data from the portable database:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:591/data?table=arrests&where=State%20%3D%20%27California%27%20AND%20Variable%20%3D%20%272017%27&dt=true'
  [
    [
      {"State":"California","Abbrev":"CA","Variable":"2017","Value":"1499","Type":"homicide-arrests","URL":"https://50statespublicsafety.us/app/themes/50state/data/arrests-dashboard/homicide-arrests.csv"},
      {"State":"California","Abbrev":"CA","Variable":"2017","Value":"2561","Type":"rape-arrests","URL":"https://50statespublicsafety.us/app/themes/50state/data/arrests-dashboard/rape-arrests.csv"},{"State":"California","Abbrev":"CA","Variable":"2017","Value":"16942","Type":"robbery-arrests","URL":"https://50statespublicsafety.us/app/themes/50state/data/arrests-dashboard/robbery-arrests.csv"},
      {"State":"California","Abbrev":"CA","Variable":"2017","Value":"88115","Type":"assault-arrests","URL":"https://50statespublicsafety.us/app/themes/50state/data/arrests-dashboard/assault-arrests.csv"},
      {"State":"California","Abbrev":"CA","Variable":"2017","Value":"212025","Type":"drug-arrest","URL":"https://50statespublicsafety.us/app/themes/50state/data/arrests-dashboard/drug-arrest.csv"},
      {"State":"California","Abbrev":"CA","Variable":"2017","Value":"666464","Type":"non-index-arrest","URL":"https://50statespublicsafety.us/app/themes/50state/data/arrests-dashboard/non-index-arrest.csv"}
      ]
    ]
```

To interact with the API, enable the Swagger interface like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ps50sr::launch_api(port = 591, docs = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "docs/imgs/api.png")
```

## Docker Deployment

For the purposes of encapsulating and deploying the **{shiny}** app and the **{plumber}** api, `Dockerfiles` have been provided under each directory. In order to run these you may need to clone the repo. Again, here a Mac terminal is used:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/cjcallag/ps50sr
```

If you have not, please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

To deploy the **{shiny}** app, navigate to the app folder inside the `inst` folder and build the Docker image with the `Dockerfile`:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd inst/ps50sr-dashboard/
docker build -t ps50sr-shinyapp .
```

Now run the image:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker run --rm -p 3838:3838 ps50sr-shinyapp
```

The **{plumber}** API can be deployed similarly, like so:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd inst/api/
docker build -t ps50sr-api .
docker run --rm -p 591:591 ps50sr-api
```
